I am a senior site reliability engineer at VMware with nearly a decade of
professional experience. I love building platforms to support running resilient
software in production.

I love taking existing services and writing intelligent code to support the
operations of those services. I have experience with Docker and technologies
designed around Linux containers, AWS, cloud native architectures,
microservices, monitoring, and automation.

While I write code mostly in Go and Python. I have been known to get into
Java, C, and Ruby to get things done. I love contributing to Open Source.

In my free time I like to try microbrews, ride bicycles, and spend time with my
family.
