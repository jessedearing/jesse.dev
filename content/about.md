+++
I am a lead software engineer at InVisionApp with over 8 years of
experience. I love databases and the technology that make databases run, but I
also have experience with Docker and technologies designed around Linux
containers, AWS, architecture, microservices, monitoring, and automation.

While I write code mostly in Go and Python. I have been known to get into
Java, C, and Ruby to get things done. I love contributing to Open Source.

In my free time I like to try microbrews, ride bicycles, and spend time with my
family.
