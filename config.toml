  about = "I am a senior site reliability engineer at InVisionApp. I love databases and the technology that make databases run. While I write code mostly in Go, Node, and Ruby I have been known to get into Java, C, and Python to get things done. I love contributing to Open Source. In my free time I like to try microbrews, ride bicycles, and spend time with my family."
