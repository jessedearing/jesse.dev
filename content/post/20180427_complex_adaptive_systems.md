Resilience engineering is becoming a required practice as people begin to expect
services to be available nearly 100% of the time. We have the same requirements
of the systems that sustain us: ecosystems, anatomical systems. Our world is one
complex adaptive system after another.

If you consider our anatomy, we have redundant systems: 2 lungs, 2 kidneys, 2
halves of the brain, 2 arms, 2 legs, etc. In cases where one of the components
is degraded, the other component is able to pick up some of the slack to sustain
life.

Because we are building systems, we as engineers must be acutely aware of how we
intend to build resilience into our systems.

## What is a system?

A system is a number of connected entities. Connected in this sense could be via a TCP
connection or it could be connected by an asynchronous delivery mechanism such
as a queue.

## What does it mean to be Complex?

Complexity is a little different in systems than in the other areas we
see it in our code. We have analysis tools that can tell us if code is too
complex based on certain criteria: long functions, too many if statements, etc.
This is complexity within a certain scope, but complexity in systems
means more connections of components. The complexity of the components
themselves are irrelevant. It doesn't matter if the component is a simple
web server or a Postgres database with 1000s of partitioned tables.

In systematic complexity the number of _connected_ components is what matters
and measuring the number of "hops" between components. We'll dive into this more
in a bit.

## What does it mean to be adaptive?

Adaptive systems are systems in which the behavior of the system changes in
response to changes in connections and the state of those connections.

## 3 properties of complex systems

### Unpredictability

Each component has it's own behaviors and because of the highly connected nature
of complex systems coupled with non-linear behaviors, it is not possible to
determine what the state of the system will be in the future. This is why during
outages and incidents multiple causes will be at play.

The unpredictability of complex systems means that we cannot predict ways in
which a system will fail, so we must have contingencies for **when systems fail,
not if**.


### Susceptibility to Contagion

Anomalies in a system can spread at a rapid rate in complex systems because of
the highly connected nature of them. A good example of this in software systems
is "cascading failures" that start when one component fails and the failure of
that component seems to spread to other components.

### Modularity - Failure Domains

Modularity is that although a complex system may be highly connected, parts of
the system emerge as entire failure domains. Think of your data tier. You may
run a clustered database like Cassandra, MongoDB, XtraDB, Galera, or
Postgres-XL. This does not insulate it from failure. Loss of quorum can lead to
unavailability for example.

Modularity is defined as well as a system is connected, some parts are more
connected than others.

## Resilience

Resilience is how we need to combat the uncertainty of a complex system. We
cannot enumerate and predict all the failure modes of a system, but we can build
contingencies for unavailability of any component. This is how We already build redundancy
into our systems. We deploy multiple instances of software, we have
active/passive configurations, etc. By employing software resiliency patterns
such as circuit breakers, bulkheads, timeouts, deadlines, and fast failures
(just to name a few) we can accept and embrace the modularity in systems.

### Redundancy

Redundancy helps mostly with failures internal to a component. A server fails, a
network is partitioned, but redundancy allows us to handle the loss. Sometimes
this means needing to have awareness of other members in a clustered
configuration but a server failure should not impact the availability of another
component. That is where modularity and resilience patterns come in.

### Define Failure Domains - Modularity

Recognizing the failure domains of a system let you define areas to employ
resilience patterns against. You know that the database is a failure domain
eventhough individual component failure is isolated by use of redundant
instances. If the database becomes unavailable, your service can still degrade
gracefully and handle failure, creating an adaptive user experience in the face
of overt failure.
