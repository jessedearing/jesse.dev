I've worked in technical leadership roles for site reliability engineering for
many different organizations. I like to build platforms on cloud infrastructure
to enable product organizations to focus on building the software and enabling
them to ship to platforms that are reliable, compliant, and can be scaled with
growth.

I love taking existing services and writing intelligent code to support the
operations of those services. I have experience with Docker and technologies
designed around Linux containers, AWS, cloud native architectures,
microservices, monitoring, and automation.

While I write code mostly in Go and some Python. I'll reach for a Bash script
when needed. I love contributing to Open Source.

I live in Portland, OR and in my free time I like to volunteer in my community,
but you can also find me at a Timbers game, riding bicycles, and spending time
with my family.
